# 🧩 Sudoku Solver — Backtracking & Genetic Algorithm

This project presents two powerful approaches for solving Sudoku puzzles using **Python**:

1. A **classic Backtracking algorithm** — fast and deterministic.
2. An **AI-inspired Genetic Algorithm** — heuristic and evolutionary.

It serves as a comparison between brute-force search and optimization through evolution.
